# Bank_customer_churn_prediction

## 1. Description
This project focuses on the prediction of bank customer churn using machine learning models. The aim of the project is to help banks improve their customer loyalty.

## 2. Data

The dataset includes the following attributes:

Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer

## 3. EDA process
**Data Cleaning**: 
  - Handling missing values 
  - Removing duplicates
    
**Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Categorical feature encoding 
  - Numerical feature scaling 
  - Checking feature correlation
    
**Model Selection and Comparison**: 
  - Building a baseline model
  - Improving baseline model by handling imbalanced target data
  - Comparing different models with hyperparameter tuning
